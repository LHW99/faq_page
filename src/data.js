      `Editing most Wikipedia pages is easy, just click the "Edit" tab at the top of a Wikipedia page (or on a section-edit link). This will take you to a new page with a text box containing the editable text of the page you were viewing. In this box you can type in the text that you want to add using wiki markup to format the text and add other elements like images and tables. If you don't want to learn the wiki markup syntax, you can enable the VisualEditor (but you must be a registered user), which allows you to edit pages in a user-friendly way. When you have finished editing you should write a short edit summary in the small field below the edit-box describing your changes.`,

If the reason is not helpful, or you disagree with it, you can click on the "talk" link to send them a message and ask.`,

      For creating a new article see Wikipedia:Your first article and Wikipedia:Article development; and you may wish to try the Article Wizard. For creating a new page in your userspace see How do I create a user subpage?; or use the Article Wizard, which has an option for that. Make sure that there is enough context and it is notable.`,

But in order to do this, you must have an account that has reached autoconfirmed status, meaning it must be at least four days old and have made at least ten edits. If you are not an autoconfirmed user, or the move is controversial, or the page you wish to rename is move protected, visit Wikipedia:Requested moves. You may also request to have an admin grant you confirmed status if you are a legitimate alternative account of an autoconfirmed user.`,

You can, however, change your username, and request that your userpage be deleted by adding the code {{db-user}} to the top of the page. See also Wikipedia:Courtesy vanishing.`,
